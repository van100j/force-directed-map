Show National Contiguity with a Force Directed Graph 
=====================

[FCC's Show National Contiguity with a Force Directed Graph challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-national-contiguity-with-a-force-directed-graph):

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/xVopBo.

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. User Story: I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.

4. User Story: I can see each country's flag on its node.

5. Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DealPete/forceDirected/master/countries.json

6. Hint: You can create a spritesheet of national flags at https://www.flag-sprites.com.
